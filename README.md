Here's a `README.md` file tailored for a repository focused on juice jacking with `Brute.sh` and `data-extractor.sh` scripts:

# JuiceJacking Toolkit

**JuiceJacking Toolkit** provides a collection of tools to simulate juice jacking attacks and study device vulnerabilities when connected to potentially unsafe USB charging stations. These scripts are designed for educational and research purposes to understand and mitigate the risks of juice jacking.

## Tools

1. **Brute.sh**
   - Simulates brute-force access attempts on connected devices via compromised USB.
   - **Usage**: `./Brute.sh [target_device] [attack_params]`
   - **Features**:
     - Executes repeated access attempts based on specified parameters.
     - Logs potential access points and weaknesses.

2. **data-extractor.sh**
   - Extracts data from connected devices, simulating how a juice jacking attack could access private information.
   - **Usage**: `./data-extractor.sh [target_device]`
   - **Features**:
     - Scans for files, messages, and contacts stored on the target device.
     - Outputs data to a designated folder for analysis.
   
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryansharma0628/JuiceJacking-Toolkit.git
   cd JuiceJacking-Toolkit
   ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x Brute.sh data-extractor.sh
   ```

3. Run the scripts with the appropriate arguments as described above.
